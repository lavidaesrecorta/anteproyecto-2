This is a new potential source for public key cryptographic schemes which are not based on number theoretic functions, and have small time and memory complexities. In the first part of the paper we analyse the scheme, explain why the two parties converge to a common key, and why an attacker using a similar neural network is unlikely to converge to the same key. However, in the second part of the paper we show that this key exchange protocol can be broken in three different ways, and thus it is completely insecure.},

  abstract = {The safety of medical data and equipment plays a vital role in today's world of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT). These IoT devices have many constraints (e.g., memory size, processing capacity, and power consumption) that make it challenging to use cost-effective and energy-efficient security solutions. Recently, researchers have proposed a few Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) based security solutions for MIoT. The use of RFID technology in securing IoT systems is rapidly increasing because it provides secure and lightweight safety mechanisms for these systems. More recently, authors have proposed a lightweight RFID mutual authentication (LRMI) protocol. The authors argue that LRMI meets the necessary security requirements for RFID systems, and the same applies to MIoT applications as well. In this paper, our contribution has two-folds, firstly we analyze the LRMI protocol's security to demonstrate that it is vulnerable to various attacks such as secret disclosure, reader impersonation, and tag traceability. Also, it is not able to preserve the anonymity of the tag and the reader. Secondly, we propose a new secure and lightweight mutual RFID authentication (SecLAP) protocol, which provides secure communication and preserves privacy in MIoT systems. Our security analysis shows that the SecLAP protocol is robust against de-synchronization, replay, reader/tag impersonation, and traceability attacks, and it ensures forward and backward data communication security. We use Burrows--Abadi--Needham (BAN) logic to validate the security features of SecLAP. Moreover, we compare SecLAP with the state-of-the-art and validate its performance through a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation, which shows that it is lightweight, consumes fewer resources on tags concerning computation functions, and requires less number of flows.},

  abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has introduced a monumental change in facilitating the management of diseases, improving diseases diagnosis and treatment methods, and reducing healthcare cost and errors. This change has greatly impacted the quality of healthcare for both patients and all frontline healthcare workers. However, the IoMT is far from being immune to security and privacy breaches due to the wide variety IoMT vendors and products available on the market as well as the massive number of devices transmitting sensitive medical data wirelessly to the cloud. The lack of security awareness among healthcare users (e.g., patients, medical staff) aggravates the deficiencies and can facilitate attacks that jeopardize the patients' lives. Therefore, ensuring the security and privacy of the IoMT becomes an urgent issue worthy of further investigation and resolution. Security cannot be planned for, managed, monitored, or controlled if it cannot be measured. However, security assessment poses problems for novice IoMT adopters when choosing security measures that are both sufficient and robust. Accordingly, we developed a web-based IoMT Security Assessment Framework (IoMT-SAF) based on a novel ontological scenario-based approach to recommend security features in IoMT and assess protection and deterrence in IoMT solutions. IoMT-SAF supports the selection of a solution that matches the stakeholder's security objectives and supports the decision-making process. The novelty of IoMT-SAF lies in its granularity, extensibility, as well as its ability to adapt to new stakeholders, and conformance to technology and medical standards.},

  abstract = {Abstract A connection between the theory of neural networks and cryptography is presented. A new phenomenon, namely synchronization of neural networks, is leading to a new method of exchange of secret messages. Two artificial networks being trained by the Hebbian learning rule on their mutual outputs develop an antiparallel state of their synaptic weights. The synchronized weights are used to construct an ephemeral key exchange protocol for the secure transmission of secret data. The complexity of the generation of the secure channel is linear with the size of the network. An attacker who knows the protocol and all details of any transmission of the data finds it difficult to decrypt the secret message.}

It has been reported that two parties can exchange secret key pairs with the synchronization phenomenon in neural networks. Although there are various models of neural cryptography, called Tree Parity Machine (TPM), many of them are not suitable for practical use, considering efficiency and security. In this paper, we propose a Vector-Valued Tree Parity Machine (VVTPM), which is a generalized architecture of TPM models and can be more efficient and secure for real-life systems. In terms of efficiency and security, we show that the synchronization time of the VVTPM has the same order as the basic TPM model, and it can be more secure than previous results with the same synaptic depth.},

  abstract = {Consumer IoT products and services are ubiquitous; yet, a proper characterization of consumer IoT security is infeasible without an understanding of what IoT products are on the market, i.e., without a market-scale perspective. This paper seeks to close this gap by developing the IoTSpotter framework, which automatically constructs a market-scale snapshot of mobile-IoT apps, i.e., mobile apps that are used as companions or automation providers to IoT devices. IoTSpotter also extracts artifacts that allow us to examine the security of this snapshot in the IoT context (e.g., devices supported by apps, IoT-specific libraries). Using IoTSpotter, we identify 37,783 mobile-IoT apps from Google Play, the largest set of mobile-IoT apps so far, and uncover 7 key results in the process ({$R$}1-{$R$}7). We leverage this dataset to perform three key security analyses that lead to 10 impactful security findings (F1-F10) that demonstrate the current state of mobile-IoT apps. Our analysis uncovers severe cryptographic violations in 94.11\% (863/917) mobile-IoT apps with \&gt;1 million installs each, 65 vulnerable IoT-specific libraries affected by 79 unique CVEs, and used by 40 popular apps, and 7,887 apps that is affected by the Janus vulnerability. Finally, a case study with 18 popular mobile-IoT apps uncovers the critical impact of the vulnerabilities in them on important IoT artifacts and functions, motivating the development of mobile security analysis contextualized to IoT.},

Information exchanged among the entities or objects, intruders can attack and change the sensitive data. The authentication is the essential requirement for security giving them access to the system or the devices in IoT for the transmission of the messages. IoT security can be achieved by giving access to authorized and blocking the unauthorized people from the internet. When using traditional methods, it is not guaranteed to say the interaction is secure while communicating. Digital certificates are used for the identification and integrity of devices. Public key infrastructure uses certificates for making the communication between the IoT devices to secure the data. Though there are mechanisms for the authentication of the devices or the humans, it is more reliable by making the authentication mechanism from X.509 digital certificates that have a significant impact on IoT security. By using X.509 digital certificates, this authentication mechanism can enhance the security of the IoT. The digital certificates have the ability to perform hashing, encryption and then signed digital certificate can be obtained that assures the security of the IoT devices. When IoT devices are integrated with X.509 authentication mechanism, intruders or attackers will not be able to access the system, that ensures the security of the devices.},

  abstract = {IoT devices are typically authenticated directly by gateways present in the network. However, in large and complex IoT systems like the smart city or smart industry which consist of thousands of connected devices, it may not be always feasible to be directly connected to the gateway while it may be possible to be connected to another device. Therefore, already authenticated devices should facilitate the new device to get authenticated by the gateway. To address this issue, the existing protocols use multiple authentication protocols based on different cryptography techniques, which are difficult to implement and manage in resource constrained IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a Transitive device authentication protocol based on the Chebyshev polynomial. The transitive authentication protocol utilizes the session key established in the mutual authentication between the intermediate device and gateway. Both the mutual authentication and transitive authentication protocols are relying on the same preregistration and authentication mechanism. To ensure the security of the proposed authentication protocol, detailed security analysis is carried out, and the secure session key establishment is verified using the BAN logic. Moreover, the proposed protocol is tested against crucial attacks in the Scyther tool. These formal analyses and Scyther attack simulation show that the proposed protocol is capable of withstanding critical attacks. Finally, to verify the efficiency, the protocol implementation is experimentally compared with similar approaches studied in the literature. The results show that the proposed protocol offers better performance, providing significantly lower response time, handshake duration, memory utilization, and energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Neural cryptography is based on synchronization of tree parity machines by mutual learning. We extend previous key-exchange protocols by replacing random inputs with queries depending on the current state of the neural networks. The probability of a successful attack is calculated for different model parameters using numerical simulations. The results show that queries restore the security against cooperating attackers. The success probability can be reduced without increasing the average synchronization time.}

At the time of exchange of sensitive information, intruders can effortlessly perform sniffing, spoofing, phishing, or Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to tamper the vital information. Information needs to be secretly transmitted with high level of encryption by preserving the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity factors. Such stated requirements urge the researchers to develop a neural network-based fast and robust security protocol. A special neural network structure called Double Layer Tree Parity Machine (DLTPM) is proposed for neural synchronization. Two DLTPMs accept the common input and different weight vectors and update the weights using neural learning rules by exchanging their output. In some steps, it results in complete synchronization, and the weights of the two DLTMs become identical. These identical weights serve as a secret key. There is, however, hardly any research in the field of neural weight vector optimization using a nature-inspired algorithm for faster neural synchronization. In this article, whale optimization-based DLTPM is proposed. For faster synchronization, this proposed DLTPM model uses a whale algorithm optimized weight vector. This proposed DLTPM model is faster and has better security. This proposed technique has been passed through a series of parametric tests. The results have been compared with some recent techniques. The results of the proposed technique have shown effective and has robust potential.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a Double Hidden Layer Neural Networks synchronization mechanism using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and mutual learning is used for the development of the cryptographic key exchange protocol. This protocol is used to exchange sensitive information through a public channel. At the time of exchanging sensitive information, an intruder can easily attack the vital information/signals by sniffing, spoofing, phishing, or Man-In-The-Middle attack. There is, however, hardly some investigation to investigate the randomness of the common input vector in the synchronization of two neural networks. This proposed technique provides GAN generated random input vectors for neural synchronization which are very sensitive to the seed value. To enhance the security of the synchronization process, GAN generates the best random sequence of the input vector. Two neural networks use GAN generated input vector and different random weight vector and swap their output. In some steps, it results in complete synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the common learning rule. The synchronized weight vector serves as a session key at the end of the neural synchronization process. An increase in the weight range increases the complexity of a successful attack exponentially but the effort to build the neural key decreases over the polynomial time. The proposed technique offers synchronization and authentication steps in parallel. It is difficult for the attacker to distinguish between synchronization and authentication steps. This proposed technique has been passed through different parametric tests. The results have shown effective and robust potential. Simulations of the process show effectiveness in terms of cited results in the paper.}

  abstract = {Recent developments in quantum computing pose a significant threat to the asymmetric cryptography currently in use. Neural cryptography offers a potential alternative that is resistant to attacks of known quantum computer algorithms. The considered solution is lightweight and computationally efficient. If a quantum computer algorithm were successfully implemented, it could expose IoT sensors and smart grid components to a wide range of attack vectors. Given the lightweight nature of neural cryptography and the potential risks, neural cryptography could have potential applications in both IoT sensors and smart grid systems. This paper evaluates one of the suggested enhancements: the use of integer-valued input vectors that accelerate the synchronization of the Tree Parity Machine. This enhancement introduces a new parameter M that indicates the minimum and maximum values of input vector elements. This study evaluates the nonbinary version of the mutual learning algorithm in a simulated insecure environment. The results indicate that, while the Nonbinary Tree Parity Machine may involve some trade-offs between security and synchronization time, the speed improvement is more substantial than the decrease in security. The impact of this enhancement is particularly significant for smaller adjustments to parameter M.}

The complexity and variability of network environments, together with the diversity of IoT devices introduce a large range of security and efficiency concerns to device authentication. In this paper, a novel interaction-based authentication (IBA) scheme is proposed to respond to the above problems. Device characteristics that can be used as identity credentials are extracted from previous interactions, and secure authentication is realized through elements matching. IoT devices can independently authenticate the identity of other devices without persistent connection to trusted third parties. From the informal analysis and simulation results, IBA supports dynamic adaptability, and high scalability, and resists several well-known attacks, such as reply attacks, impersonation attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The comparison analysis indicates that IBA has better security and performance compared with related authentication schemes, thereby demonstrating it is more suitable for the actual IoT environment.},
